MONDAY 

1. Use the command line to run asciify.py (included in the assignment repo). What does this script do? Include a screenshot of your results. 

- This script takes an image as an input and converts it into ASCII art by passing it as an argument.

- The screen shot is in my repository under the name "github cat.PNG" I need to figure out how to create folders with my repo. When I tried creating a new file it only created a document.

2. Install the Delorean Python package. What command did you use? Then, from the command line, launch Python. Use it to execute the following commands: 

- Command used: $ pip install delorean

from delorean import Delorean
EST = "US/Eastern"
d = Delorean(timezone=EST)
print(d)

What prints to the command line?  
- Delorean(datetime=datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 13, 22, 43, 1, 217105), timezone='US/Eastern')

3. Use the command line to download http://www.colorado.edu/. What command did you use? Make sure to include this file as part of your submission. 

- Command used: wget http://www.colorado.edu/
- *File in repository 

4. Search the downloaded file from #3 for the word "Colorado." What command did you use? How many lines did this find?

- Command used: $ cat index.html | grep -ni Colorado | wc -1
- This found 81 lines, or instances, in which colorado is mentioned

5. Now, print the lines containing the word "Colorado" to a file to "search_results.html". What command did you use? Include this file as part of your submission. 

- Command used:
