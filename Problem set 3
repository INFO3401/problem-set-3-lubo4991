MONDAY 

1. Use the command line to run asciify.py (included in the assignment repo). What does this script do? Include a screenshot of your results. 

- This script takes an image as an input and converts it into ASCII art by passing it as an argument.

- The screen shot is in my repository under the name "github cat.PNG" I need to figure out how to create folders with my repo. When I tried creating a new file it only created a document.

2. Install the Delorean Python package. What command did you use? Then, from the command line, launch Python. Use it to execute the following commands: 

- Command used: $ pip install delorean

from delorean import Delorean
EST = "US/Eastern"
d = Delorean(timezone=EST)
print(d)

What prints to the command line?  
- Delorean(datetime=datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 13, 22, 43, 1, 217105), timezone='US/Eastern')

3. Use the command line to download http://www.colorado.edu/. What command did you use? Make sure to include this file as part of your submission. 

- Command used: $ wget http://www.colorado.edu/
- *File in repository 

4. Search the downloaded file from #3 for the word "Colorado." What command did you use? How many lines did this find?

- Command used: $ cat index.html | grep -ni Colorado | wc -1
- This found 81 lines or instances of "colorado"

5. Now, print the lines containing the word "Colorado" to a file to "search_results.html". What command did you use? Include this file as part of your submission. 

- Command used: 
$ grep -i colorado index.html > search_results.html
- *File located in repo

WEDNESDAY 

1. If I were to hypothetically collect and analyze CU's data system to determine if frequent rec usage resulted in a higher GPA I would look at the following:
- The amount of times a student swipes their card to enter the rec facility per week/month/semester vs. their semester GPA or month by month GPA. 
- You could also look at the time of day in which they go to the rec and frequency of rec usage vs. GPA.
- It might also be interesting to check the amount of times someone checks out equipment, the type of programs they've inlisted in at the rec, the day of the week they are going, if they are renting a locker, and fall vs spring semester usage frequency.
